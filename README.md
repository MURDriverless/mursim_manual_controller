# mursim_manual_controller
Package to manually control the simulation using WASD 

W - Forward 
S - Backward
A - Turn Left
D - Turn Right

The more you press a key the more the action intensifies, if you push the backward key more than the forward key it will eventually go backwards.
Kapeesh?


Simply run the package when you have launched the gazebo simulation
`rosrun mursim_controller keyboard`

Does not depend on any other package.
